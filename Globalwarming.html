            <p>Global warming is the long-term rise in the average temperature of the Earth's climate system.
             It is a major aspect of current climate change, and has been demonstrated by direct temperature
             measurements and by measurements of various effects of the warming.The term commonly refers to
             the mainly human-caused increase in global surface temperatures and its projected continuation.</p>
            
             <h2><a id="causes">Causes</a></h2>
            <p>Global warming occurs when carbon dioxide  and other air pollutants and greenhouse gases collect
             in the atmosphere and absorb sunlight and solar radiation that have bounced off the earth’s surface.
             Normally, this radiation would  escape into space—but these pollutants, which can last for years to
             centuries in the atmosphere, trap the heat and cause the planet to get hotter. That's what's known as 
             the greenhouse effect.</p>
            
             <h3>Land use change</h3>
            <p>Changing the type of vegetation in a region impacts the local temperature by changing how much sunlight 
            gets reflected back into space, called albedo, and how much heat is lost by evaporation. For instance, 
            the change from a dark forest to grassland makes the surface lighter, causing it to reflect more sunlight. 
            Humans change the land surface mainly to create more agricultural land.Since the pre-industrial era, albedo
            has increased due to land use change, which has a cooling effect on the planet. Other processes linked to 
            land use change however have had the opposite effect, so that the net effect remains unclear.</p>

            <h2><a id="effects">Effects</a></h2>
            <p>The environmental effects of global warming are broad and far-reaching. They include effects on the oceans,
            ice, and weather and may occur gradually or rapidly.</p>
             
            
              <h4>Accelerating Sea Level</h4>

              <ul><li>Rise  Global warming is accelerating the rate of sea level rise and dramatically increasing coastal flooding
                 risks, especially on the U.S. East Coast and Gulf of Mexico.
              </li></ul>
              <h4>Longer and More Damaging Wildfire Seasons </h4>

              <ul><li> Wildfires are increasing and wildfire season is getting longer in the Western U.S. as temperatures rise. 
              </li></ul>
              <h4>More Frequent and Intense Heat Waves  </h4>
              <ul><li>Dangerously hot weather is already occurring more frequently than it did 60 years ago. 
              </li></ul>
              <h4> Costly and Growing Health Impacts</h4>
              <ul><li> Climate change has significant implications for our health, including increased air pollution and a longer and
                 more intense allergy season.
              </li></ul>
              <h4> Heavier Precipitation and Flooding </h4>
              <ul><li>As temperatures increase, more rain falls during the heaviest downpours, increasing the risk of flooding events.
              </li></ul>
              
              <h2><a id="solutions">Solutions</a></h2>
              
              <h4> Reduce emissions</h4>
              <ul><li>We must significantly reduce the heat-trapping emissions we are putting into the atmosphere. As individuals, we 
              can help by taking action to reduce our personal carbon emissions. But to fully address the threat of global warming,
               we must demand action from our elected leaders. 
              </li></ul>
              <h4>Stop deforestation  </h4>
              <ul><li>Tropical deforestation accounts for about 10 percent of the world’s heat-trapping emissions. Reducing tropical deforestation can significantly lower global warming emissions and plays an integral role in a comprehensive long-term solution to global warming.
              </li></ul>
              <h4>Boosting energy efficiency </h4>
              <ul><li>The energy used to power, heat, and cool our homes, businesses, and industries is the single largest contributor to
                 global warming. Energy efficiency technologies allow us to use less energy to get the same—or higher—level of production,
                 service, and comfort. This approach has vast potential to save both energy and money, and can be deployed quickly.
              </li></ul>
                <h4>Managing forests and agriculture</h4>
               <ul><li>Taken together, tropical deforestation and emissions from agriculture represent nearly 30 percent of the world's 
                 heat-trapping emissions. We can fight global warming by reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation 
                 and by making our food production practices more sustainable.
               </li></ul>
